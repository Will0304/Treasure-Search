# Treasure-Search
Simple interactive Treasure Search Game. This was done as a quick back-up (extra) project for CS120 course at school.
The distance feedback is expressed in x & y distances of the click from the target; the coordinate differences are converted to cm;

To top the game up with other simple features (as time permitted) the following was done:
1. Prompt for the name of the user;
2. Attempt amount setter which allowed different levels of difficulty;
